# Visualising Fitts' Law with D3

Fitts's Law is one of the corner stones of user interface research. Published in 1954, Fitts described the relation between the target distance, width and time needed of a target acquisation task, which later became known as Fitts' law [Fitts 1954].

This interactive illustration of the Fitts' test should serve as an introduction to Fitts' law as well as visualise details not directly covered by it, to give further insights into motion in 2D target acquisition tasks.
